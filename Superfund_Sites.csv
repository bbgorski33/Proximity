The Site is located in a rural setting east of MO State Highway 177 in the SW part of Section 22, Township 31 North, Range 14 East. The facility operated a pesticide formulation plant from 1965-75. Plant wastes were discharged into a 2-cell lagoon on site.  Chlordane, Aldrin, Endrin & Heptachlor were detected in soil and onsite monitoring wells. An EPA inspection in 1983 revealed that the lagoon cover was eroding and that no vegetation existed on the clay cap. Cape Girardeau, with a population of 60,925, draws drinking water from the Mississippi River, at a location less than 1 mile downstream of the site.  Approximately 200 people live within 1 mile of the site, and 1,284 live within 3 miles. The site is adjacent to the flood plain of the Mississippi River. A freshwater wetland is located within 1 mile of the site.    

The selected remedies for OU1 and OU2 addressed the threat posed by the pesticides, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and semi-volatile organic compounds in the lagoon, groundwater and the formulation building.  The remedies included the excavation of 6,479 cubic yards of contaminated soil and sediment at the lagoon, complete demolition of the formulation building with off-site disposal of the debris, and monitoring of the groundwater to verify that no unacceptable exposure to risks posed by conditions at the site occur in the future, and therefore no remedial action wasrequired for the groundwater.  There are currently no land use restrictions for the Site. Neither is it on Missouri's Registry of Confirmed, Abandoned, or Uncontrolled Hazardous Waste Sites in Missouri. The site has been delisted from the NPL in September 2001 since it is no longer a threat to public health or the environment.

AMD used trichloroethylene (TCE) and other industrial solvents for cleaning and degreasing, although TCE use reportedly ceased around 1979. Acids were used for etching, and caustics were used for acid neutralization. Acid neutralization systems, including inground sumps, were used at both AMD buildings between 1969 and 1984. Related hazardous wastes generated from these various operations were stored on-site. Additional studies of groundwater contamination in the 1980s identified chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs), primarily TCE, cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (cDCE) and vinyl chloride, in the upper 65 feet of soil under the AMD Site.",2020-05-07,2020-05-07,EPA Five year review,https://semspub.epa.gov/work/09/100018396.pdf,EPA Five Year Review,,0.020014092,Miles,"The Agency is providing this geospatial information as a public service and does not vouch for the accuracy, completeness, or currency of data.
